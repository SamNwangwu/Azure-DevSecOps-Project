# Security Enhancements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented to address the SonarQube findings.

## 1. RBAC Configuration

We've implemented proper Role-Based Access Control for the monitoring components:

- Created a dedicated ServiceAccount for Grafana
- Defined a specific Role with limited permissions
- Established a RoleBinding to connect the ServiceAccount and Role

This ensures that Grafana operates with the principle of least privilege.

## 2. Resource Limits

We've added CPU and memory resource limits to all containers:

- Grafana: 0.5 CPU, 512Mi memory
- Prometheus Server: 1 CPU, 1Gi memory

Resource limits prevent denial of service scenarios where a compromised container could consume excessive resources.

## 3. Storage Management

For existing PVCs, we've documented a comprehensive strategy for production environments:

- Create StorageClasses with appropriate quotas
- Implement namespace-level storage limits
- Set up monitoring and alerts for storage consumption

See the detailed approach in `pvc-documentation.md`.

## Validation

All security measures have been validated through:

1. Kubernetes API inspection
2. Manual verification of deployed resources
3. Documentation of implementation and future enhancements

These security enhancements demonstrate the DevSecOps principle of addressing security findings as part of the development process, rather than as an afterthought.
